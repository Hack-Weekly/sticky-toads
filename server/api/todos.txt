Improve Error Handling, this Bionic Can Do But if Sheep Wants to Help He Can.

-- 

Keep track of the users assigned to card, before that tho I need to revise the schema.

---

Create middleware that automatically checks on certain endpoints wether or not a user session is active
if not then error handle accordingly by throwing a 'User Session Not Found Error' or Redirect. 

---

Error handling has been improved to an extent, but I couldnt do much tonight so I will continue in the morning.
